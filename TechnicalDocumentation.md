## Introduction

A longer description about the project. What problem does it solve? Who is the target audience?

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
### **Additional Recommendations for the Readme**

After the primary structure, let's look at some specific sections in more detail:

#### **Usage**
Provide step-by-step examples of how to use the software, highlighting common use cases and configurations. This could include simple code snippets or commands the user can execute.

#### **Running the Tests**
Elaborate on how to run the automatic tests for this system:
- Specify any necessary setup or data required before testing.
- Mention different types of testing that are available (unit tests, integration tests, etc.), and how to initiate each.

#### **Deployment**
Detailed instructions on how to deploy the software in a live system:
- Cover required environment settings, configuration files, or dependencies that need to be set up specifically for deployment.

#### **Built With**
List major frameworks, libraries, or tools that were used to create the project:
- Hyperlink the tool or framework to its official page to make it easier for new users to find the resources they need quickly.

#### **Architecture**
Describe the logic architecture of the project and if possible, a diagram showing the different components and how they interact. Recommended if the project has more than two agents (a simple server-client project has two agents).
It Also includes a brief explanation of the design patterns used in the project. As well as communication patterns.
If the project is heavily based on Cloud Architecture, include the services used and how they interact.

API Documentation, if the project has less than five endpoints, includes them in the README, otherwise, link to an external documentation. Preferably Swagger.

#### **Error and Monitoring**
Explain how errors are handled in the project, including logging and monitoring:
- Describe the logging system used, and how to access logs.
- Mention any monitoring tools or services that are integrated into the project, and how to use them.

#### **Contributing**
Provide guidelines on how prospective contributors can participate in the project:
- Link to a CONTRIBUTING.md file if available, which should include standards for coding practices, pull request guidelines, and the roadmap for upcoming features.

#### **Versioning**
Information on the versioning scheme used for the project, advice on how to access different versions, or how to see the change log. This could include:
- Instructions or links on how to use Git tags to find specific releases.
- A brief explanation of the semantic versioning system (or another system, if used), linking to external resources or documentation if necessary.

#### **Authors**
- List of people who have contributed significantly to the project.
- You might include their contact information, GitHub profiles, or other relevant links.
