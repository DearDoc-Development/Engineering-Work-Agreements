"Testing is not just about finding bugs, but about building confidence in your software."

Software testing is a critical component of the software development lifecycle that ensures applications meet quality standards and function as expected. Among the various testing methodologies, functional testing stands as one of the most fundamental approaches to validating software behavior.

The types of functional testing include:
1. **Unit tests**: Low-level tests of individual methods/functions, cheap to automate and quick to run.
2. **Integration tests**: Verify different modules work together (e.g., database interactions), requiring multiple components.
3. **Functional tests**: Focus on business requirements, verifying outputs without checking intermediate states.
4. **End-to-end tests**: Simulate complete user flows in the full application environment.
5. **Acceptance testing**: Formal verification that the system meets business requirements.
6. **Performance testing**: Evaluate system behavior under specific workloads for speed, reliability, and scalability.
7. **Smoke testing**: Quick checks of basic functionality to ensure core features work.


## Functional Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests represent the most granular level of testing, operating directly on the application's source code. They evaluate the functionality of discrete methods and functions within your classes, modules, or components. These tests are typically inexpensive to implement in automated testing pipelines and execute rapidly when run on continuous integration platforms, making them ideal for frequent validation during development cycles.

Popular tools for unit testing include:
- **Vitest**: Modern testing framework, simple configuration and startup. 
- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **Mocha**: A flexible JavaScript test framework for Node.js and browsers.
- **Chai**: An assertion library for Node.js and browsers, often used with Mocha.
- **Pytest**: A testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases.
- **JUnit**: A widely used testing framework for Java applications.

Example: 
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers
 * @param a The first number
 * @param b The second number
 * @returns The sum of a and b
 */
export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

```typescript
describe('sum function', () => {
  it('should add two positive numbers correctly', () => {
    expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });

  it('should handle negative numbers', () => {
    expect(sum(-1, -2)).toBe(-3);
    expect(sum(-1, 2)).toBe(1);
  });

  it('should handle zero', () => {
    expect(sum(0, 5)).toBe(5);
    expect(sum(5, 0)).toBe(5);
  });
});
```


### Integration Tests

Integration tests assess how separate modules or services within your application interact with each other, validating their combined functionality. These tests examine critical connections between components, such as database interactions or communication between microservices in distributed architectures. As they require multiple system components to be operational simultaneously, integration tests typically consume more resources and time to execute than unit tests, representing a higher level of testing complexity in your verification pipeline.

Popular tools for integration testing are similar to unit testing, as many frameworks support both types of tests.

Example:
```typescript
export class CalculatorService {
  add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return sum(a, b);
  }

  calculateTotal(numbers: number[]): number {
    return numbers.reduce((total, current) => sum(total, current), 0);
  }
}
```

```typescript
import { CalculatorService } from './calculator';

describe('Calculator Integration', () => {
  let calculator: CalculatorService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    calculator = new CalculatorService();
  });

  it('should use sum function for adding two numbers', () => {
    // Test integration between calculator and sum function
    const result = calculator.add(5, 7);

    expect(result).toBe(12);
  });

  it('should use sum function repeatedly to calculate total', () => {
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const result = calculator.calculateTotal(numbers);

    expect(result).toBe(15);
  });
});
```

### Functional Tests

Functional tests evaluate whether software components fulfill specific business requirements and produce expected outputs without examining internal system states during execution. These tests verify that an application's features work according to product specifications from an end-user perspective. While both functional and integration tests involve multiple system components, functional tests are distinguished by their focus on validating business outcomes rather than technical connections. For example, where an integration test might confirm a database connection functions properly, a functional test would verify that the system retrieves specific data values that match defined business rules and user requirements. This outcome-oriented approach makes functional tests essential for validating that the software delivers the intended business value.

Example:
```typescript
import { CalculatorService } from './calculator';

export interface InvoiceItem {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}

export class BillingService {
  constructor(private calculator: CalculatorService) {}

  calculateItemTotal(item: InvoiceItem): number {
    return this.calculator.add(0, item.price * item.quantity);
  }

  createInvoice(items: InvoiceItem[]): {
    items: Array<InvoiceItem & { total: number }>;
    subtotal: number;
    tax: number;
    total: number;
  } {
    const itemsWithTotals = items.map(item => ({
      ...item,
      total: this.calculateItemTotal(item)
    }));

    const subtotal = this.calculator.calculateTotal(
      itemsWithTotals.map(item => item.total)
    );
    
    // Apply 10% tax
    const tax = subtotal * 0.1;
    const total = this.calculator.add(subtotal, tax);

    return {
      items: itemsWithTotals,
      subtotal,
      tax,
      total
    };
  }
}
```

```typescript
import { CalculatorService } from './calculator';
import { BillingService, InvoiceItem } from './billing';

describe('Billing Integration Tests', () => {
  let calculatorService: CalculatorService;
  let billingService: BillingService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    calculatorService = new CalculatorService();
    billingService = new BillingService(calculatorService);
  });

  it('should calculate item total correctly', () => {
    const item: InvoiceItem = {
      name: 'Product A',
      price: 10,
      quantity: 2
    };

    const total = billingService.calculateItemTotal(item);
    expect(total).toBe(20);
  });

  it('should create a complete invoice with multiple items', () => {
    const items: InvoiceItem[] = [
      { name: 'Product A', price: 10, quantity: 2 },
      { name: 'Product B', price: 5, quantity: 4 },
      { name: 'Product C', price: 15, quantity: 1 }
    ];

    const invoice = billingService.createInvoice(items);

    expect(invoice.items.length).toBe(3);
    expect(invoice.items[0].total).toBe(20);
    expect(invoice.items[1].total).toBe(20);
    expect(invoice.items[2].total).toBe(15);
    expect(invoice.subtotal).toBe(55);
    expect(invoice.tax).toBe(5.5);
    expect(invoice.total).toBe(60.5);
  });

  it('should handle empty invoice', () => {
    const invoice = billingService.createInvoice([]);

    expect(invoice.items).toEqual([]);
    expect(invoice.subtotal).toBe(0);
    expect(invoice.tax).toBe(0);
    expect(invoice.total).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end testing evaluates the complete functionality of an application by simulating real user interactions in a production-like environment. These tests validate entire workflows from start to finish, ensuring all integrated components work together properly as users would experience them. End-to-end tests can range from basic scenarios like verifying page navigation and form submissions to complex sequences involving multiple systems such as payment processing, email notifications, and third-party service integrations.

While end-to-end tests provide the highest level of confidence in application functionality, they come with significant trade-offs.

Popular tools for end-to-end testing include:
- **Playwright**: A Node.js library for automating Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.
- **Puppeteer**: A Node.js library for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
- **TestCafe**: A Node.js tool for testing web applications across all browsers.

### Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing constitutes a formal verification process that evaluates whether a system fulfills defined business requirements and specifications. Unlike lower-level tests, acceptance tests operate in a complete application environment, validating software from the user's perspective by simulating real user interactions and workflows. These tests serve as the final quality gateway before software delivery, confirming that the developed solution meets stakeholder expectations and delivers the intended business value.

Popular tools for acceptance testing include:
- **Cucumber**: A tool for running automated tests written in plain language.
- **Robot Framework**: A generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).

### Performance Testing

Performance testing evaluates system behavior under specific workloads to assess speed, reliability, responsiveness, and scalability characteristics. These tests systematically measure how an application performs against established benchmarks by simulating various operational conditions, from normal usage patterns to peak load scenarios.

Popular tools:
- **Gatling**: A powerful open-source load testing framework based on Scala.
- **Locust**: A scalable load testing tool written in Python.
- **K6**: A modern load testing tool for developers, using JavaScript.

### Smoke Testing

Smoke testing provides rapid verification of an application's critical functionalities to ensure core features work correctly before proceeding with more extensive testing. These lightweight tests examine fundamental system behaviors—such as application startup, user authentication, and key operational paths—without diving into detailed functionality or edge cases. By validating that essential components operate as expected, smoke tests serve as an efficient first-line quality check in the testing process.
